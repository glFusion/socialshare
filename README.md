## Overview

The SocialShare Plugin has a significant amount of flexibility on how you can utilize Share Buttons on your site. As mentioned above, this plugin leverages the AddToAny share service.

SocialShare will provide a small, pop-up menu of share services. The list of services presented in this pop-up is dynamic. You can select services to **Prioritize**, which forces them to show in the small pop-up, but additional services may appear as well based on the user's social memberships or previous shares.

You also have the ability to **Exclude** services if you wish. When a service is excluded, it will not be displayed or available in either the small pop-up menu or the full share window.

The Social Share Buttons have the ability to display share counts. It is important to note that not all share services support displaying counters. The following services are known to support share counters are:

*  Facebook
*  LinkedIn
*  Pinterest
*  Reddit
*  Tumblr
